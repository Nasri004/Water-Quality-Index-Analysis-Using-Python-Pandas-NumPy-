# Water-Quality-Index-Analysis-Using-Python-Pandas-NumPy-
This project analyzes water quality data stored in Excel files using Python. Pandas and NumPy are used to preprocess data and calculate multiple Water Quality Indices (WAWQI, WGWQI, OWQI). The results classify water quality into standard categories to support environmental monitoring and decision-making.
